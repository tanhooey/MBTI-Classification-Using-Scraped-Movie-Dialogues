Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.\\nYou know French?\\nGuess who just signed up for a tutor?\\nYou could consecrate with her, my friend. Cameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building.\\nYeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.\\nThe mewling, rampalian wretch herself. Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint\\nYou're in school for one day and you ask out the most beautiful girl? Do you have no concept of the high school social code? Cameron grins away\\nUnlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the point? Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab tables away. He's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles as he tries to revive his frog.\\nYou wanna go out with him? The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows\\nWhat makes you think he'll do it?\\nI'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.\\nDid she actually say she'd go out with you?\\nYou know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list. With me by your side.\\nHey -- I've gotta have a few clients\\nI'll let you handle that.\\nHey.\\nNope - just came by to chat\\nHear me out. You want Bianca don't you? Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing.\\nBut she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?\\nSo what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her. Someone who's up for the job. Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage can, rather than in it.\\nExactly Joey turns to look at Michael.\\nOh, hey, nothin' man Purely good will on my part. He rises to leave and turns to the others.\\nLike we had a choice? Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca. Cameron grins and puts an arm around him\\nHe took the bait.\\nWhat?\\nThe situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.\\nThat's where we can help you. With Kat.\\nPatrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl. Patrick smiles. He likes the idea of Joey being a pawn in this game.\\nWe're your guys.\\nWe're in.\\nIn that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.\\nAre you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.\\nOne question before we start -- should you be drinking alcohol when you don't have a liver?\\nGood enough. Cameron looks up at Patrick.\\nIt's a lung cancer issue\\nDead at forty-one. Patrick sits up\\nJust for now.\\nHe's pretty!\\nEver been to Club Skunk?\\nAssail your ears for one night.\\nYou told me that part already.\\nUh, yeah. We're old friend*\\nWhat? We took bathes together when we were kids. It's incredibly obvious that he's lying. Joey eyes him then turns to Cameron.\\nHey -- it's all for the higher good right?\\nMoose, my man! Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters have already started calling. Cameron nods intently\\nYo, Clem.\\nFollow the love, man\\nExtremely unfortunate maneuver.\\nButtholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress.\\nAt least you're self-aware\\nSo you got cozy with she who stings?\\nI'm on it\\nHey there. Tired of breathing?\\nCool pictures. You a fan?\\nMICHAEL rocks. Very hip.\\nOh yeah. She looks at him suspiciously\\nMacbeth, right?\\nKat a fan, too?\\nSweet love, renew thy force!\\nBest case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.\\nMi' lady. Good sir. Patrick rolls his eyes.\\nFeces hitting fan. C'mon Michael takes Cameron aside, leaving Mandella and Bianca staring after them.\\nJoey, pal, compadre. Let's take it easy. Joey turns toward Michael and Cameron.\\n\", 'E', 'N', 'T', 'P', '#DavidKrumholtz']\n"
