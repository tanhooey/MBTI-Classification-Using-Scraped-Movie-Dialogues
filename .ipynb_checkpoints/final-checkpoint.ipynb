Last week\\nI\\'ve managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I\\'m in this kind of place, he\\'ll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly.\\nSorry. Really sorry. Got a little agitated. The thought of escaping crossed my mind and suddenly...suddenly\\nYou dumb assholes! I\\'m a mental patient! I\\'m supposed to act out. Wait til you\\nJEFFREY\\'S VOICE Torture! Experiments! We\\'re all monkeys\\nNot as bad as what they\\'re doing to kitty.\\nWiping cut the human race! That\\'s a great idea! But it\\'s more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.\\nYou know -- your plan.\\nWhat\\'re you writing? You a reporter?\\nJEFFREY\\'S VOICE Monkey Business! Monk Key Business.\\nGet it? Monk - Key. Monk! Key!\\nJEFFREY flashes his palm open for one quick moment. A KEY!\\nWooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load! Listen up -- try and get it together. Focus! Focus! The plan!\\nNot, \"what\", babe! When! \"When???\"\\nNow!\\nWhat are you talking about? What friend? I\\'m not expecting anyone.\\nThis is ridiculous. My father is making a major address.\\nNever saw him before in my life. Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.\\nThat would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles. See, he definitely doesn\\'t know me. Now, I\\'m going to go back and listen to my father\\'s very eloquent discourse on the\\nExcuse me -- what did you say?\\nJEFFREY frowns, turns, considers COLE. Then, suddenly, JEFFREY\\nArnold...Arnold.\\nMy God, Arnie, what\\'s happened to you? You look like shit\\nJEFFREY throws an arm around COLE\\'S shoulder and starts leading\\nArnold Pettibone. Old Arnie Pettibone. Used to be my best friend. Still is. What\\'ve you lost, Arnie -- forty pounds?\\nHey, nice ta see ya. Lookin\\' good! Hi, there. Yes, it has been a long time.\\nCounty Hospital, right? 1989. The\\nWe need to talk. Come on. Upstairs.\\nJEFFREY studies COLE. COLE doesn\\'t just talk crazy. He looks crazy!\\nCome on, follow me. You don\\'t lock so good.\\nJEFFREY starts guiding COLE up the grand staircase as COLE, glancing\\nRemember? We were in the dayroom,\\nYou\\'re right! Absolutely right. Me\\'s a nut case, totally deranged. Delusional!\\nJEFFREY, BEN, TEDDY, and two of JEFFREY\\'S youthful cohorts, SANDY\\nWhine, whine, whine. What about walkie talkies? We used to have walkie talkies.\\nYou get the bolt cutters?\\nYou really want to know?\\nEx-psychiatrist! Now, what about flashlights? How many flashlights...?\\nJEFFREY abruptly switches from rage to good humor, adopting a supercilious smile and a patronizing tone.\\nJEFFREY Then, using the computer model, they\\nJEFFREY smiles smugly into FALE\\'S flabbergasted face.\\nJEFFREY exits. The others stare at the door.\\nLet\\'s do it!\\nOkay, that\\'s Stage One. In Stage Two, Monkey Four is over here...\\nAh, but cruelty is his specialty.\\nWant the full effect?\\nJEFFREY puts his finger to his lips, silencing everyone.\\nJEFFREY??? ... Very well. You\\'re out\\nJEFFREY raises his eyebrows. This he hadn\\'t expected.\\nWhat...virus?\\nWhat virus are we talking about, Dad?\\nYou \"develop\" viruses and you\\'re calling me insane? Typical.
