Kat, played by actress Julia Stiles, is a proud, antisocial, nonconforming feminist who listens to Riot Grrrl music, Letters to Cleo and reads books such as The Bell Jar. She is against dating and often \"sneers at the idiocy of teenage social life.” Kat is based on Katherina Minola (the “shrew”) in The Taming of the Shrew. She begins to date Patrick Verona towards the middle of the film after rejecting his numerous attempts to court her.'],\n",
